# rnb

This branch is the same as `main` but with the addition of a BabylonJS boilerplate.

To add BabylonJS to this project, what I've done is this steps:

- Runned `npm i --save react-native-permissions --legacy-peer-deps`
- Runned `npm i @babylonjs/core@5.0.0-alpha.34 @babylonjs/react-native`
- Added simple test component to Home page from [BabylonJS React Native Readme](https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonReactNative/blob/master/Modules/@babylonjs/react-native/README.md)
